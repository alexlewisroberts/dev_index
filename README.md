# dev_index

This is the source repository for a [Heroku dashboard](https://dev-index-dashboard.herokuapp.com/).

We use data for countries mostly from data.worldbank.org to develop clusters of similar countries, a developmental index, analyze trends and plot them on a world map.

getting_data shows how data.csv was created using APIs.
